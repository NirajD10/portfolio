Using Figma, I meticulously prototyped and designed the website over the course of 1-1.5 weeks. The design process involved a thorough exploration of layout, color schemes, typography, and imagery to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.Every aspect of the design was carefully considered to provide an enjoyable browsing experience for our users. The design of PurePlantParadise reflects my dedication to creating a beautiful and intuitive online shopping environment for indoor plant enthusiasts.",
        "designimageurl": "/Projects/pureplantparadise/Design_Prototype.png",
        "development": "For PurePlantParadise, I utilized the MERN stack to develop the site, ensuring efficiency and scalability. Before diving into code, I meticulously crafted schema relationships for MongoDB, prioritizing stability and minimizing the need for future changes.
	On the frontend, I opted for React with Tailwind CSS for styling, incorporating pre-built components from Shadcn and customizing them to align with my vision. To manage state effectively, I employed Redux for global state management, while leveraging Tanstack Query for asynchronous state management and API refetching. For seamless navigation, React Router Dom handled routing seamlessly.
	Moving to the backend, I leveraged API endpoints to facilitate data flow. Using Mongoose for MongoDB ORM simplified database operations, while Firebase served as the image storage bucket, with URLs converted to store in MongoDB collections. Deployment was streamlined with Netlify handling frontend deployment and Render.com for backend deployment."
